# Project 2 - *NYT Searcher*

**NYT Searcher** is an android app that allows a user to search for articles on web using simple filters. The app utilizes [New York Times Search API](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/read/article_search_api_v2).

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **search for news article** by specifying a query and launching a search. Search displays a grid of image results from the New York Times Search API.
* [x] User can **scroll down to see more articles**. The maximum number of articles is limited by the API search.
* [x] User can tap on any image in results to see the full text of article **full-screen**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Used the **ActionBar SearchView** or custom layout as the query box
* [x] User can **share an article link** to their friends or email it to themselves
* [ ] Improved the user interface and experiment with image assets and/or styling and coloring
* [x] User can click on "settings" which allows selection of **advanced search options** to filter results
  * [x] User can configure advanced search filters such as:
    * [x] Begin Date (using a date picker)
    * [x] News desk values (Arts, Fashion & Style, Sports)
    * [x] Sort order (oldest or newest)
  * [x] Subsequent searches have any selected filters applied to the results
* [x] Replaced Filter Settings Activity with a lightweight modal overlay
* [ ] Implements robust error handling, [check if internet is available](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Sending-and-Managing-Network-Requests#checking-for-network-connectivity), handle error cases, network failures
* [ ] Apply the popular [Butterknife annotation library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Reducing-View-Boilerplate-with-Butterknife) to reduce view boilerplate.
* [x] Replace `GridView` with the [RecyclerView](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-the-RecyclerView) and the `StaggeredGridLayoutManager` to improve the grid of image results displayed
* [x] Replace Picasso with [Glide](http://inthecheesefactory.com/blog/get-to-know-glide-recommended-by-google/en) for more efficient image rendering.
* [x] Before an article search is triggered by the user, displays the current top stories of the day by default.
* [x] Hides the `Toolbar` at the top as the user scrolls down through the results using the [CoordinatorLayout and AppBarLayout](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-the-App-ToolBar#reacting-to-scroll).
The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
* [x] Implemented Parcelable
